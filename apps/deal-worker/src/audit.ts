/**
 * Append a domain event and its audit row, as two plain statements.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `EventsRepository.appendEventWithAudit`: in the cirrus
 * baseline that method is one Postgres statement (`WITH … INSERT … RETURNING`, `row_to_json`, `FULL JOIN`)
 * inherited from the Postgres baseline, and SQLite — so D1 — rejects DML
 * inside a CTE. RB1 applies the tested fix to it (runbook trap 16), but this
 * worker does not depend on the patched path either way. Here the event goes in through
 * `appendEvent` (portable) and the audit row is copied from it with an
 * `INSERT … SELECT`, which SQLite runs.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: the write it describes has already committed (D1 has
 * no interactive transactions), so a failure is logged and swallowed rather
 * than turned into a 5xx that would tempt a client to retry a write that
 * succeeded.
